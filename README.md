# NextJS Template

## Why?
Because ```create next-app``` creates a bunch of junk files that I just end up deleting. So I made this little neat template for myself, which barely has any useless files. Its nothing amazing, but just works!

## How to use?
Just run `git clone https://github.com/odincat/nextjstemplate.git .` in your project folder. Then run `yarn install`. Now its ready to use.

## Whats included?
- SASS (scss) file.
- Github actions workflow which runs `yarn lint` and `yarn build`
- Example Footer
- @ paths
## Whats not included?
- Files that nobody needs
